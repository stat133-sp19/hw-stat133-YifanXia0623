Vignettes are long form documentation commonly included in packages. Because they are part of the distribution of the package, they need to be as compact as possible. The `html_vignette` output type provides a custom style sheet (and tweaks some options) to ensure that the resulting html is as small as possible. The `html_vignette` format:

- Never uses retina figures
- Has a smaller default figure size
- Uses a custom CSS stylesheet instead of the default Twitter Bootstrap style


## Binomial

The package `"Binomial"` is a minimal implementation for calculating the relative probability of number of successes in total trials by using the given number of trials, successes and probability.      

### 1) Choose inputs for binomial variables    

You can choose inputs by using the function `bin_choose(n,k)`, where n is the total number of trials, and k is the number of successes in n trials.    
```{r}
bin_choose(n=10,k=1)
```


### 2) Get the probability with the given inputs (successes,number of trials,and probability)  

After choosing the inputs (successes,number of trials,and probability), you will get the probability by using the function `bin_probability(success, tirlas, prob)`.      
```{r}
bin_probability(success = 2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

### 3) Get a dataframe with the given inputs (number of trials and probability)
After choosing the inputs (number of trials and probability), you will get a dataframe with consequtive number of trials from 0 to your inputs(trials) and their corresponding probability by busing the function `bin_distribution(trials,prob)` .    

```{r}
dis1 <- bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
dis1
```

### 4) Plot the probability dataframe.     
Plotting the histogram of probability dataframe we got before by using the function `plot()`.     
```{r}
plot(dis1)
```


### 5) Getting cumulative probabilities for all possible successes values.        
After choosing the inputs (number of trials and probability), you will get a dataframe with consequtive number of trials from 0 to your inputs(trials) and their corresponding probability and cumulative probability by using the function `bin_cumulative(trials,prob)` .         

```{r}
bin_cum<- bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
bin_cum
```
### 6) Plot cumulative probability distribution
Plotting the probability and cumulative dataframe we got before by using the function `plot()`.    
```{r}
plot(bin_cum)
```


### 7) Create a `binomial variable` with your desired inputs (number of trials and probability)  
You can create a`"bin_var` with the function `bin_variable(trials,prob)`    
```{r}
bin_var <- bin_variable(trials=5,prob=0.5)
bin_var
```


## 8) Get a summary of your binomial variable    
You can use the function `summary()` to get a summary of your binomial variable.    
```{r}
bin_sum <- summary(bin_var)
bin_sum
```



### 9) Various measure of your binomial variable.   
If you want to explore more and get the details of your binomial variable, you can use the following measure functions.    
`bin_mean` for the mean your desired binomial diribution.     
`bin_variance` for the variance your desired binomial diribution.     
`bin_mode` for the mode your desired binomial diribution.          
`bin_skewness` for the skewness your desired binomial diribution.       
`bin_kurtosis` for the mean your desired binomial diribution.         

```{r}
bin_mean(10,0.5)
bin_variance(10,0.5)
bin_mode(10,0.5)
bin_skewness(10,0.5)
bin_kurtosis(10,0.5)
```
