### Binomial

The package Binomial is a minimal implementation for calculating the probability, cumulative probability of a certain number of success in many trials. Also, this package allows you to find the summary of the result and plot it.

### Finding the total number of combinations

The fucntion `bin_choose(trials,k)` allowes you to input a total number of trials(trials) and number of success(k) and it will output the number of combinations to have k success in n trials.
```{r}
#ways of having 3 success in 5 trials
bin_choose(trials=5,success=3)
```

### Find the probability

Next, we can_ use function `bin_probability(success, trials, prob)` to find the probility of having a certain number of success in trials with a probabilty of success(prob). The function `bin_choose(trials,success)` is invoked in it.
```{r}
#probability of having 3 success in 5 trials
bin_probability(success=3,trials=5,prob=0.5)
```

### Find the binomial distribution plot

After finding the probility of each number of success, we can use `bin_distribution(trials, prob)` and `plot.bindis(table)` to create a probability table with columns: success and probilities, and a barplot of the distribution. The input of `plot.bindis(table)` is the distribution table we get from `bin_distribution(trials,prob)`. The function `bin_probability(success, trials, prob)` is invoked in it.
```{r}
dis_table <- bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
plot.bindis(dis_table)
```

### Find the cumulative binomial distribution

The function `bin_cumulative(trials, prob)` gives us cumulative binomial distribution of all possible number of success, which is the sum of all probabilities of successes less than and equal to a number, `plot.bincum(table)`gives us a line diagram showing the trend of probability change. The input of `plot.bincum(table)` is the distribution table we get from `bin_cumulative(trials,prob)`.
```{r}
cum_table <- bin_cumulative(trials=5, prob=0.5)
plot.bincum(cum_table)
```

### Get information

Function `bin_variable()` and `summary.binvar()` give informations about out binomial distribution. `bin_variable()` outputs a list listing number of trials and probability that the user set. `summary.binvar()` is also a list listing number of trials, probability, mean, variance, mode, skewness, and kurtosis. `print.binvar()` and `print.summary.binvar()` display the result of `bin_variable()` and `summary.binvar()`nicely.
```{r}
bin_var <- bin_variable(trials=5,prob=0.5)
bin_var
summary(bin_var)
```
