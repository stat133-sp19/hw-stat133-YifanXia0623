### 10A


#### part a)

```{r}
df <- read.table("/Users/mac/Downloads/hw/hw10/chicks.txt",header = TRUE)
head(df)
```
The standard regression model is y = β0 + β1x + e in this case is cw=β0+β1el+e.
```{r}
df %>% ggplot(aes(x=el,y=cw)) + geom_point()
```
The plot shows a linear trend and roughly homoscedastic, therefore we can assume that the model is reasonable.
```{r}
#mean of el
mean_el <- mean(df$el)
mean_el
#mean of cw
mean_cw <- mean(df$cw)
mean_cw
#correlation of cw and el
corr <- cor(df$el,df$cw)
corr
```
β1 is the slope of regression line and β0 is the intersection
```{r}
#slope of the regression line
β1 <- cov(df$el,df$cw)/var(df$el)
β1
#interception of the regression line
β0 <- mean_cw - β1*mean_el
β0
```
We can draw the regression line using these varaiables
```{r}
df %>% ggplot(aes(x=el,y=cw)) + geom_point() + geom_abline(slope = β1, intercept = β0)
```

#### part b)

```{r}
reg <- lm(formula=df$cw~df$el)
summary(reg)
```
```{r}
df %>% ggplot(aes(y=cw,x=el))+ geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm,se=FALSE)
```
We got the same result by using lm() as in part a. The t test for intercept here is testig whether the intercept is 0. We can tell from the test that p-value is 0.19 which is large enough to support the null(intercept is 0). F test is testing the same thing as t test for slope. They both test whether the slope is 0. Accroding to both p-value, which is consistent, we have enough evidence to reject the null that slope is 0.
